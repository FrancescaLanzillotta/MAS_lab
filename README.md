## Stochastic Value Iteration in a Grid

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to implement the value iteration algorithm in a 6x6 grid, populated by a goal, an agent and a number of enemies. 
Through the algorithm we can define an optimal policy so that our agent can reach the goal while avoiding the enemies. 

### Implementation
In the following image we can see an example of the populated grid where:
- &#9873; is the goal
- ● is the agent
- &#11043; are the enemies
- ✘ is the obstacle

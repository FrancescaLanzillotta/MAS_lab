## Stochastic Value Iteration in a Grid

The goal of this project is to implement the value iteration algorithm in a 6x6 grid, populated by a goal, an agent and a number of enemies. 
Through the algorithm we can define an optimal policy so that our agent can reach the goal while avoiding the enemies.
